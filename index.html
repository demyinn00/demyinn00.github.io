										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>I can't promise perfection, but I can promise accountability.</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										Hi, I'm David Em-Yinn, and ever since I was a kid, I have always had a deep fascination for technology. 
                                        When the iPhone came out, I wanted to create apps. When I was 12 taught myself HTML/CSS and Javascript, but 
                                        I had a lot of trouble learning on my own. It wasn't until I stepped into college and took my first fundamental computer science
                                        courses that solidified my love for this field. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Now, I spend my days exploring new opportunities to learn and grow in this field. I have built and worked on projects that 
										challenged me, which strengthened my skillset. I believe that the projects on this website have prepared me for new opportunities. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I often spend my pastime listening to music or playing the guitar when I'm not coding. Other times, I find myself out and about 
										enjoying nature and hiking. In fact, I took the header photo shown on this website when I went to Point Lobos State Natural Reserve in Monterey. 
										In addition, I generally like to stay in shape by working out and training in martial arts.

												<h5>Sept 2021 - Dec 2021</h5>
												<p>
													This is a CRUD app that my team and I created. This app allows users to search for recipes, save recipes to a list, etc. <br>
													I created E2E and unit tests for the application. I also contributed to designing the CICD pipeline for this project.
												</p>
												<h5>What I learned</h5>
												<p>
													This project taught me how to work in a team and simulate working as a software engineer. I learned the importance of 
													planning and creating a design. Moreover, I learned more about the AGILE work environment and the concept 
													of CICD. For example, designing a workflow for the team to follow so that we can create small incremental changes to the application.
													I learned how to prepare automated tasks on Github. For example on a Pull Request, my E2E and unit tests will run automatically.
													Moreover, I learned how to step up and become a GOOD leader.

												<h5>Aug 2021 - Sept 2021</h5>
												<p>
													Since I turned 21 in 2021, I created a fun and simple black jack game at the end of summer. 
													This game was developed with python and uses Tkinter for the GUI; however, the GUI is in progress.
													Player can hit or stand and will play against the dealer which follows standard casino rules. 
												</p>
												<h5>What I learned</h5>
												<p>
													This was my first python project and it taught me through trial and error. 
													Despite Black Jack's simplicity, I underestimated the design of this project and edge cases.
													When designing this project, there were a plethora of ways I can implement each componanent of the project.
													For example, implentation of the deck, cards, and hand. In this case, I made them classes and took advantage of 
													OOP.

												<a href="https://github.com/demyinn/node3-weather-website" class="icon brands fa-github"><span> Repo</span><h4>Weather App</h4></a>
												<h5>Apr 2020 - May 2020</h5>
												<p>
													This app allows a user to check the weather at any address or location. The app uses Mapbox to geocode the location 
													and then uses weatherstack to find the weather at that location. 
												</p>
												<h5>What I learned</h5>
												<p>
													This project taught me many basics of Node.js and HTML/CSS. Moreover, this project taught me how to pull and parse data from APIs.
													This also taught me the difficulties of designing a project and the differences between a web-app vs website. I also learned how to use
													Github and how to deploy an application. This project helped me learn a lot of fundamentals that would prepare me for the iCook Recipe Manager project.

												<h4>Infrared Goal Sensors with Arduino</h4>
												<h5>Jan 2020 - Mar 2020</h5>
												<p>
													Unfortunately, I created this before I knew how to use Github so I lost the code. <br>
													This project was for OCC STEM Club. We were creating soccer kicking robots and needed to create features for the arena.
													My team and I decided the first feature to create was an automate goal sensor, so that we don't have to manually
													increment the score board. The code was written in C++ and it would increment a 7 segment display every time a goal was scored.
													The ball would pass through the IR sensors which would cause them to disconnect and increment the score. <br>
													We weren't able to put this project into action on the actual arena because of the pandemic. 
												</p>
												<h5>What I learned</h5>
												<p>
													This project taught me a completely different side of engineering. I learned how to wire and code an arduino board. 
													This was the first time using an arduino board, so I had to spend a lot of time researching how to use a breadboard for wiring and how to 
													make circuits that will connect the display to the arduino board. I also had to research how to code the arduino to communicate with the 
													7 segment display. After all my research, I had to teach this to my team and take on a leadership position.
